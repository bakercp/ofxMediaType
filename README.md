ofxMediaType
============

## Description

This is an addon that makes it easy to discover MIME types.  The basic implementation (contained in this addon) uses the Apache Mime Types definitions found here:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types?view=co

Other MIME-type discovery implementations (e.g. via libMagic, libAV) etc can easily be created by implementing `BaseMediaTypeProvider`).  See https://github.com/bakercp/ofxLibmagic for an example.
